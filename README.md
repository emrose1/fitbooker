# Bookings using MEAN

## Usage

Install `generator-angular-fullstack`:
```
npm install -g generator-angular-fullstack
```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run `yo angular-fullstack`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo angular-fullstack [app-name]
```

Run `grunt` for building, `grunt serve` for preview, and `grunt serve:dist` for a preview of the built app.

## Prerequisites

* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) - If you plan on scaffolding your project with mongoose, you'll need mongoDB to be installed and have the `mongod` process running.


## To install dependencies from scratch

`npm install -g bower grunt-cli`

`bower install`

start mongodb `mongod`

Run `grunt` for building, `grunt serve` for preview, and `grunt serve:dist` for a preview of the built app.

### Heroku

Deploying to heroku only takes a few steps.

    yo angular-fullstack:heroku

To work with your new heroku app using the command line, you will need to run any `heroku` commands from the `dist` folder.


If you're using mongoDB you will need to add a database to your app:

    heroku addons:add mongohq

Your app should now be live. To view it run `heroku open`.

#### Pushing Updates

    grunt

Commit and push the resulting build, located in your dist folder:

    grunt buildcontrol:heroku


## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the client and server unit tests with karma and mocha.

Use `grunt test:server` to only run server tests.

Use `grunt test:client` to only run client tests.

**Protractor tests**

To setup protractor e2e tests, you must first run

`npm run update-webdriver`

Use `grunt test:e2e` to have protractor go through tests located in the `e2e` folder.

## Environment Variables

Keeping your app secrets and other sensitive information in source control isn't a good idea. To have grunt launch your app with specific environment variables, add them to the git ignored environment config file: `server/config/local.env.js`.
